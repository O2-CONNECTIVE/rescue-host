# Actual producer connection CI

The `Actual producer connection` workflow runs the reviewed `ci-producer/`
fixture on standard GitHub-hosted `macos-26` ARM64 VMs with Go 1.27.3. Normal
and race are independent matrix jobs with fail-fast disabled. Each compiles
its own helper, resident test binary and transport test binary. Actions are
commit-pinned, checkout identity is checked, modules must remain unchanged,
and the build and execution steps have module network access disabled.

Each job first runs the exact in-memory parser, trust validation, per-instance
TLS clone and certificate-byte ownership regressions. It then requires all four
real TLS rejection cases: wrong CA and wrong hostname through both worker and
resident-control transports. A strict JSON
gate rejects skipped, missing, duplicate or unexpected tests, including exact
subtest counts. Live phases also require the original test's confirmed result
and successful exit. Only then can
`TestCIActualProducerConnection` launch the hash-pinned producer helper and
exercise real pipes, resident control, verified TLS and MCP fixed work.

The background keeper and foreground observer run in the same shell step.
Fresh per-phase invocation IDs bind the result, original-process join and
immutable observer verdict. Old results cannot be reused. Failure or an
observation deadline fails the job without signalling, retrying, replacing
owners or running the next phase. A late successful exit cannot overwrite a failed
observer verdict. The observer budgets are 180 seconds for TLS negatives and
900 seconds for the producer, within a 30-minute job limit. Runner destruction
after failed/unknown is disposal, not evidence of cleanup. A newer commit does not cancel a running job.

The job log and summary expose only fixed phase/lane labels, outcome, source
revision and helper SHA256. Use the job's GitHub Actions link when reporting
results. No artifacts, raw runtime logs, fixture credentials or policy files
are uploaded. See [the fixture contract](../ci-producer/README.md) for exact
ownership and cleanup assertions. This is instrumented-source connection
coverage, not signed launcher, GUI, real dot-account or deployment acceptance.
